# This is the URL that is retrieved to get the netinstall groups-and-packages
# data (which should be in the format described in netinstall.yaml), e.g.:
#   groupsUrl: http://example.org/netinstall.php
# or it can be a locally installed file:
#   groupsUrl: file:///usr/share/calamares/netinstall.yaml
#
# Note that the contents of the groups file is the **important**
# part of the configuration of this module. It specifies what
# the user may select and what commands are to be run.

# The format of the groups file is documented in `README.md`.

# If the installation can proceed without netinstall (e.g. the Live CD
# can create a working installed system, but netinstall is preferred
# to bring it up-to-date or extend functionality) leave this set to
# false (the default). If set to true, the netinstall data is required.
#
# This only has an effect if the netinstall data cannot be retrieved,
# or is corrupt: having "required" set, means the install cannot proceed.
